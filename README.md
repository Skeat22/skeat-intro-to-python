Hello! This is my intro to python code repository that contains a few practical applications using python. All of which have come up from brainstorming needs with friends. Enjoy!



# Installing Python
Follow this link for a python setup how-to (there are tons, but this is the most recent good one I have found)

Alternatively here are the big steps I would recommend:
1. visit https://www.python.org/downloads/ and find the download that best suits your system (windows vs. mac vs. linux)
2. Double click the download to begin installation. If you are brand new almost all the defaults should be fine except one thing you want to make sure to select the following on the first step of the installer (becomes very important for almost all python exercise/applications) (/images/gpy-to-path.PNG)
